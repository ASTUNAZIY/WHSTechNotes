- The only part that was confusing to me was about how to create another entry in the journal that we had made other than that that was the only issue that botherd me andi still don't know if i'm doing this entry in the same journal
- There was a particular instruction that i had a problem all os overall no im just confused on how to make a differnt entry in the journal file i had created or do i need to make another journal file to add another entry
